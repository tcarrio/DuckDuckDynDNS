# DuckDuckDynDNS

Self-hostable DynDNS Alternative

## Overview

Having looked at other dynamic DNS solutions and realizing how simple the idea was, I decided to throw together a CLI that would update a DNS entry from a running server. The initial motivation came to me while setting up my at home VPN and looking up my IP address on DuckDuckGo. It returned an IP address via the Answers API, so my solution unironically uses the same. **dddd** hits the DuckDuckGo Answers API, parses the returned IP address, and will create or update a DNS entry in Cloudflare. I believe this solution would be easy to throw in a cronjob for scheduled updates, as well as manual invocation. Currently it is heavily driven by arguments or environment variables.
